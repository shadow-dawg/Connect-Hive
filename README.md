## 🧠 Problem

- Existing platforms like **LinkedIn** focus on large-scale networking, not proximity-based collaboration.
- Local professionals, freelancers, and creators often **don’t know about talent nearby** — losing real-world synergy opportunities.
- Hackathons, college projects, startups, and film crews still rely on word-of-mouth or WhatsApp groups for finding teammates.

**ConnectHive** provides a **map-based, AI-assisted networking app** that helps you:

- Instantly find professionals and creatives **within your local radius**.
- Create or join **hyperlocal collaboration hubs**.
- Automatically integrate **project tools like GitHub, Figma, or Notion** when starting new ventures.
